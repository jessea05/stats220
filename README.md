# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Science, majoring in Statistics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to broaden my statistics knowledge when using a computer.
- I am interested in learning about how to use the different computational tools and how they will help me in the future.
