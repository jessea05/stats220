# STATS 220
## Jesse Austin
This is my repo for **STATS 220**. 

A little about me:

* I am undertaking a degree in Science, *majoring in Statistics*.
* I am taking **STATS 220** because I want to broaden my statistics knowledge when using a computer.
* I am interested in learning about how to use the different computational tools and how they will help me in the future.

Things I enjoy to do in my free time:

1. Football
2. Walk and play with my dog
3. Video games
4. Watching sport
